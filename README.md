Emotion based Audio Compression 



I recently found a paper titles "The Effects of MP3 Compression on Perceived Emotional Characteristics in Musical Instruments" 



This paper examines the impact of MP3 compression on the emotional characteristics by conducting listening tests. The experiment compared compressed and uncompressed samples at different bit rates across ten emotional categories. The results revealed that MP3 compression enhanced negative emotions like Mysterious, Shy, Scary, and Sad while diminishing positive emotions like Happy, Heroic, Romantic, Comic, and Calm. MP3 compression reduced positive emotions and amplified negative emotions such as Mysterious and Scary.
